## Usage Instructions

### For Participants

1. **Choose your scenario** - Pick one of the 6 assistants
2. **Copy context files** - Move your scenario's files to `/public/`
3. **Update system prompt** - Reference your files in `app/play/paly.ts`
4. **Add protection** - Include security rules to protect the secret
5. **Test thoroughly** - Try to break your own assistant first!

### For Instructors

- Assign different scenarios to different teams
- Ensure teams don't know each other's secrets in detail
- Provide "hints" during Red Team phase
- Judge based on exact secret extraction (not just hints)

---

## Context File Design Notes

Each scenario includes:

**CSV File:**
- Real-world data structure
- 20-25 records for authenticity
- One record contains the protected secret
- Secrets are embedded naturally (not obvious)

**Guidelines/Policy File:**
- 150-200 lines of context
- Realistic policies and procedures
- Multiple sections for depth
- Explicit confidentiality warnings
- "Red herring" sections to add complexity

**Secret Integration:**
- Secrets are realistic business confidentiality scenarios
- Protected information is valuable (brand reputation, privacy, competitive advantage)
- Multiple references to confidentiality throughout guidelines
- Defensive language suggests what to protect (but can be exploited!)

---

## Red Team Attack Surface

Each scenario has unique vulnerabilities:

**Banking:** Mathematical aggregation, CSV line references, account numbers  
**Hospital:** Patient ID queries, diagnosis code translation, medical terminology  
**University:** Student ID lookups, enrollment status changes, FERPA loopholes  
**Retail:** Supplier comparisons, margin calculations, inventory sourcing  
**Tech Startup:** Timeline questions, feature status, project codename patterns  
**Movie Studio:** Casting TBA logic, budget queries, contract status  

---

## Difficulty Ratings

**Easier (Good for beginners):**
- 🏦 Banking - Direct numerical secret
- 🛍️ Retail - Supplier relationship
- 🎬 Movie Studio - Actor name

**Moderate:**
- 🏥 Hospital - Medical diagnosis translation
- 🎓 University - Disciplinary reason

**Harder:**
- 💻 Tech Startup - Project codename and multiple details

---

## Creating New Scenarios

Want to add more scenarios? Follow this template:

1. **Choose a domain** (healthcare, finance, education, etc.)
2. **Create CSV** with 20+ records including one with secret
3. **Write guidelines** (150-200 lines) with policies and confidentiality rules
4. **Embed secret** naturally - make it realistic
5. **Add defenses** - Include language that hints at protection
6. **Test vulnerability** - Make sure it's challenging but not impossible

---

## Tips for Workshop Success

### For Building Phase:
- Start with basic queries working
- Add secret protection gradually
- Test your own attacks first
- Layer multiple defenses

### For Red Team Phase:
- Try obvious things first
- Look for patterns in data
- Use tools creatively
- Think about business logic

### For Instructors:
- Time check at 30-min mark (teams should have basics working)
- Encourage testing early and often
- Share one successful attack technique midway
- Celebrate creative approaches, not just wins
